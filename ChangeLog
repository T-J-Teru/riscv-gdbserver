2017-06-25  Jeremy Bennett  <jeremy.bennett@embecosm.com>

	This will not currently compile, but shows how the interface via
	the debug unit should work.

	* configure: Regenerated.

2017-06-25  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	* targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: (RUN_SAMPLE_PERIOD) Add.
        (resume) When step is CONTINUE, step for RUN_SAMPLE_PERIOD
        instructions; if timeout expired, return TIMEOUT.
        Otherwise, repeat. Default timeout if none supplied is
        zero, resulting in single-stepping.

2017-06-24  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	Partially-working implementation of Picorv32

	Reading and writing memory and registers works, as does
	single-stepping instructions. Breakpoints are not presently
	working.

        * server/GdbServer.cpp: (RISCV_PC_REGNUM) Remove, as it seems a
	bit specific to Picorv32 (it handles the PC differently to the
	rest of the register file).
        * targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: (RISCV_PC_REGNUM) Add.
        (resume) Implement, but only single-stepping - no mutiple steps
	with timeouts. (terminate) Add comment. (reset)
	Implement. (readRegister, writeRegister) Fix handling of PC, which
	is a special case.

2017-06-24  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	* targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: (readRegister, writeRegister)
	(read, write) Implement.

2017-06-24  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	Although this builds, the Picorv32 implementation is not yet
	functioning because the functions of Picorv32 are not yet
	implemented. Mostly they will be able to call into the
	Picorv32Impl class, but some of the functions will need a little
	more work.

	class should be very similar to the original Cpu class
	implementation, and the Picorv32 class adapts it and implements
	the ITarget interface.

	Some of the choices made here are not completely future-proof;
	when we add a second core (RI5CY) we may have problems with
	linking.

        * Makefile.in: Regenerate.
        * server/Makefile.am: Link with Verilated Picorv32 libraries.
        * server/Makefile.in: Regenerate.
        * targets/picorv32/Makefile.am: Compile Picorv32.cpp and
	Picorv32Impl.cpp. Include target, target/common, and verilated
	Picorv32 folders. Don't warn on unused params.
        * targets/picorv32/Makefile.in: Regenerate.
        * targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: Replace old Cpu implementation
	with stub implementations of all methods of the Picorv32 class.
        * targets/picorv32/Picorv32Impl.cpp: Include Picorv32Impl.h,
	rename Cpu class to Picorv32Impl.
        * targets/picorv32/Picorv32Impl.h: Rename Cpu class to
	Picorv32Impl.

	* server/GdbServer.h: Include <inttypes.h> with STDC_FORMAT_MACROS.
	* targets/ITarget.h (class ITarget): Pass first argument to read

2017-06-07  Jeremy Bennett  <jeremy.bennett@embecosm.com>

	Infrastructure for an abstracted target interface class, ITarget.
	All targets should implement the interface class ITarget, declared
	in the "targets" subdirectory.  Each target should be in its own
	subdirectory of the "targets" directory.  There is also a "common"
	subdirectory for code common to all targets.

	The result is the libtargets library, which can be linked into the
	server code, which can instantiate the target of choice.  The
	current framework has placeholders for the PicoRV32 and RI5CY
	verilator models.

	Add in the autotools generated files.  I know that there is a
	debate about whether to do this.  But we'll follow the GNU tool
	chain practice of doing so.  It means you can clone and build out
